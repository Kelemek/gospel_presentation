# Pin-Click Functionality Test

## Feature Description
Users can now click on the pin icon (üìç) in highlighted verses (last viewed scripture) to clear their progress and remove the highlight.

## Test Steps
1. Navigate to a non-default profile (e.g. http://localhost:3000/basic)
2. Click on any scripture reference button to view it - this will highlight it as the "last viewed"
3. The verse should now appear with a yellow highlight and a pin icon (üìç)
4. Click specifically on the pin icon (üìç) - NOT the scripture reference button
5. The highlight should disappear and the progress should be reset

## Expected Behavior
- **Pin Click**: Clears the progress and removes highlight
- **Scripture Button Click**: Still opens the scripture modal and sets new progress
- **Visual Feedback**: Pin has hover effect (darker yellow) and cursor pointer
- **Tooltip**: Shows "Click to clear progress" on hover

## Technical Implementation
- **Event Handling**: Pin click uses `stopPropagation()` to prevent triggering scripture button
- **State Management**: Calls `resetProgress()` function from the scripture progress hook
- **API Integration**: DELETE request to clear progress from profile data
- **Visual Design**: Pin is clickable with hover states and tooltip
