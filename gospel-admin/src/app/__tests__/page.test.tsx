// Kept as a placeholder so historical test intent is preserved. If you want this behavior
// re-tested, consider re-implementing integration tests that target the current `/default`
// Include a skipped placeholder test so Jest treats this as a valid test file
// (prevents "Your test suite must contain at least one test" failures).
